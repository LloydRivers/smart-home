# Smart Home Project

This repository contains the code for our university project focusing on building a smart home application.

## Tools Used

- TypeScript
- Vitest

## Coding Style

We follow Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

## Design Patterns

Observer Pattern: Through the Observable base class and IObserver interface

Command Pattern: With the ICommand interface and concrete commands like StoreDataCommand
Single Responsibility Principle: Each class has one primary responsibility
Open/Closed Principle: New commands can be added without modifying existing code
Interface Segregation: Small, focused interfaces that classes can implement as needed

Needs links adding and a general tidy
